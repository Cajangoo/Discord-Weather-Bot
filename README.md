⚠️Remember to put on .env the discord bot token and the APIs keys.⚠️

This is how it looks, its especially developed for Brazilian Users, but u can trade "clima" for "weather" and "desligar" for "shutdown" and the names on weatherMessage from PT/BR to EN. 

Make the modifications in ./commands/weather and ./commands/shutdown  paths !!!!
